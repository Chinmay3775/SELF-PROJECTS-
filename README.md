# Simple Calculator

I created a **Simple Calculator** using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

### Key Features:
- **HTML** provides the structure of the calculator, including buttons for digits and operations, and a display area for showing the input/output.
- **JavaScript** handles the core functionality, performing basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **CSS** is used to style the calculator, giving it a clean and modern look, and ensuring it's responsive across different devices.
- The calculator is fully functional and intuitive, allowing users to perform quick calculations seamlessly.

This calculator is a great project for demonstrating front-end web development skills, particularly focusing on DOM manipulation with JavaScript.
